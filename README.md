# Bachelor Thesis Source Code
Source code accompanying my bachelor thesis.
/neural_network and /baseline are modified versions of the [NeuralWarp implementation](https://github.com/josifgrabocka/neuralwarp) supporting the [NeuralWarp paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08306).

## Requirements
The project uses the following libraries:
* TensorFlow 1.13 (version 2.0 not supported yet)
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* FastDTW
* Scipy
* Kafka-Python
* Scikit-Learn
* JobLib

## Hardware
The project used the following hardware:
* Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-7900X CPU @ 3.30GHz
* 64GB RAM
* 2x ZOTAC GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB (the source code expects that two graphics cards are available)

## Data
Due to the high storage requirements, the raw and preprocessed data cannot be made available here. 
These data can be downloaded [here](https://seafile.rlp.net/d/0da47f572ab747f4b2e0/) separately.
